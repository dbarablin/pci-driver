# pci-driver

pci-driver is a Rust crate that enables you to develop user-space PCI and PCIe
drivers. It currently achieves this using Linux's VFIO, but is designed to be
extended to other "backends" in the future.

pci-driver is available on crates.io at https://crates.io/crates/pci-driver. The
documentation is at https://docs.rs/pci-driver.
